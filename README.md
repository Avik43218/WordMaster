# WordMaster: A Flask-Based Word Guessing Game

Welcome to **WordMaster**, a dynamic, web-based word guessing game built using **Flask**, **HTML/CSS**, and **Python** — featuring multiple difficulty levels, scoring, hints, and a clean interactive UI.

## 🧠 Game Logic

- Players get one word per round.

- They are shown a hint and a masked version of the word.

- Guessing the full word correctly grants 10 points.

- Incorrect guesses reduce the number of available attempts.

- After 10 rounds, the game ends and the final score is shown.

---

## 🛡️ Security and Input Validation

- All inputs are sanitized and validated to prevent spam guesses like the full alphabet.

- Sessions are managed using Flask’s secure session system.

- Secrets like the SECRET_KEY are loaded through environment variables.
